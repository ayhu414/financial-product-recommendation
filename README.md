# financial-product-recommendation

Our team has decided upon the Santander Product Recommendation dataset from Kaggle to be our primary dataset for our final project. This dataset comes directly from a Kaggle competition, originally hosted by the Spanish bank Santander. We believe that this will not only allow us to engage with a dataset from a field that we have not yet explored in depth in class, but also allows us to focus strongly on the analysis component rather than the data engineering component (which this class does not necessarily focus on directly). 

For the particular structure of the data, this dataset contains anonymized customer geodemographic data, anonymized financial account data, and 1.5 years worth of customer purchase behavior data, where each row represents a consumerâ€™s purchase mix by a particular time stamp. (Note that this data does not track each individual customer through time, rather it is fixed-timed)

Our goal is to build a robust model that can help Santander recommend financial products to its existing customers based on their past behavior and that of similar customers. The key analyses that we wish to conduct will include a suite of different models to test out their performance, which includes but is not limited to (multinomial) logistic regressions, random forests, and primarily collaborative filtering techniques. We will also explore the data with summary statistics and visualizations before conducting the ML component, and keep the door open for other methods as we dive deeper into the data fields and relative methods.
